In 1998 the Doom source code was released. Since then, there have been a
large number of Doom source ports created by programmers who have extended
the code, adding new features and removing some of the limitations of DOS
Doom (which is now often referred to as "Vanilla Doom"). These efforts
should be commended, and many of the modern Doom source ports are truly
impressive pieces of work.

Chocolate Doom, however, takes the opposite approach. It instead aims to
accurately reproduce the experience of playing Vanilla Doom. It is a
conservative, historically accurate Doom source port, which is compatible
with the thousands of mods and levels that were made before the Doom source
code was released. Rather than flashy new graphics, Chocolate Doom's main
features are its accurate reproduction of the game as it was played in the
1990s.

Originally just a port of the Doom source code, the purpose of the project
has evolved to include ports of Heretic, Hexen and Strife, commercial games
that were based on the Doom engine.

The source code to Chocolate Doom is Free Software under the GNU General
Public License, and is portable to a variety of different operating systems.
It therefore preserves the gameplay of the original game for modern
computers, many of which are now unable to run the original.
